 * Implements per-request level logging by queuing all log records until the request ends and then producing an atomic log block for the
 * entire request. Also allows to define a threshold which, if exceeded at any given time during a request, leads to a decreased logging
 * threshold, thus providing more details when really needed. This mechanism is called the audit mode. See /README.md for details.
